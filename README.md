# EAR-SEM-SIS



## Brief description of the application

The system is a simple version of KOS, maintaining courses, students, teachers, rooms. Teachers can create a course and schedule them into rooms that restrict the capacity of the course. Students can enroll into the course unless the course has no more capacity left. Students can list courses they are enrolled into, teachers can list courses that they teach. 

Courses can be grouped into “programs”. A course can be bound to another course, in such a way that it’s recommended to attend a course(s) before attending the one. Courses can be tagged as Mandatory, Voluntarily forced, Optional.  

Each student can print in pdf format a study summary and a study confirmation document.
